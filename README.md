# tweet-the-wolf

### Getting Started

Like a wolf howling in the night, you too can shout into the distance in search of an answer.  
Now anyone can tweet a [Wolfram|Alpha](wolframalpha.com) query with the inclusion of a [#tweetthewolf](twitter.com/search?q=tweetthewolf) hashtag.

Give it a try! And if you listen closely,
...you just might hear him.

or even touched - they must be felt with the heart"  -Helen Keller
